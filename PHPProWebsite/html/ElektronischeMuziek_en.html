					<a href="#Jaar-3">Year 3</a>
					<a href="#Jaar-4">Year 4</a></p>
					<p id="Jaar-1">In the first year the attention will be centered around the basics of Instrumental knowledge. You will be tested on a technical and acadamic level. In terms of assignments, the goal will be to know more about the instrument yourself as you work though the assignments.</p>
					<p id="Jaar-2">In the second year you will go deeper into the knowledge to get an even better understanding of the instruments. There will also be lessons in the economic part of the profession. At the end of the second year you will be able to make a classic instrument yourself and adjust it right.</p>
					<p id="Jaar-3">In the third year you will do an internship for six months. You are free in your choice to do the internship in the Netherlands or abroad, your role/function during the internship and what kind of assignment you will do for the company.</p>
					<p id="Jaar-4">In the first half of the fourth year you will follow a minor. You may choose what you want to follow, but it is recommended to follow something that fits with your studies. This will ultimately give you an advantage in the working field. In the second half of the year you will do a graduation research. What kind of research and where doesn't matter, as long as it has something to do with classic instrument construction.</p>
