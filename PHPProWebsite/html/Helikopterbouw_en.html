	<p id="Jaar-1">The Study starts with an introduction period. In the first block you will become acquainted with the subject Helicopter construction. After the introductory period, you and a group will do the assignment called "Miniature helicopter". You will make a mini helicopter from various parts, such as lego or waste. The goal is to be actively involved with the study and a team. You also learn basic technology knowledge. In the second and third period you learn more and more about the technology behind the helicopter. At the end of the year you will get a test about everything that you will have learned in year 1. This test must be passed to follow year 2.</p>
	<p id="Jaar-2">In year 2, there will be a focus on taking a deeper look at the history/knowledge of the helicopter. In the first half of the year you will learn how to make or obtain helicopter parts yourself and the assignments will also reflect this. The course "Economic skills" will also be introduced. In the second half you will learn how to assemble a helicopter well and make it work. The final project of year 2 will be disassembling a basic helicopter.</p>
	<p id="Jaar-3">In the third year you will do an internship for six months. You are free in your choice to do the internship in the Netherlands or abroad, your role/function during the internship and what kind of assignment you will do for the company.</p>
	<p id="Jaar-4">In the fourth year you will take a minor for half a year and do a graduation project in the other half. The graduation project will involve building a helicopter with a team, without any help except for budget. This will mean that you have to get all the materials yourself and also have to arrange everything yourself.</p>
